# Algorithms_and_Abstract_Data_Types
Lab Submissions from Algorithms and Abstract Data Types course @ UCSC
<ul>
  <li> This folder comtains implementations of Graph, DDL
    	 and Matrix ADTs in C and Java. </li>
  
  <li> Be mindful of java implementations. Matrix class 
    	 runs a little slow. List class could use a good 
       potential debugging in a perfect world. </li>

  <li> Be mindful of list class in C. Use implementation
  		 from pa5. Graph ADT in pa4 is somewhat subpar with
   		 memory leaks. Graph ADT in pa5 is ideal. </li>
</ul>
