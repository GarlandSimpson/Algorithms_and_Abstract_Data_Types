# Algorithms_and_Abstract_Data_Types
Lab Submissions from Algorithms and Abstract Data Types course @ UCSC
<ul>
  <li> This folder comtains implementations of Graph, DDL
    	 and Matrix ADTs in C and Java.</li>
  
/***********************************************************
***		 
***
***		-Be mindful of java implementations. Matrix class 
***		 runs a little slow. List class could use a good 
***      potential debugging in a perfect world.
***
***		-Be mindful of list class in C. Use implementation
***		 from pa5. Graph ADT in pa4 is somewhat subpar with
***		 memory leaks. Graph ADT in pa5 is ideal.
